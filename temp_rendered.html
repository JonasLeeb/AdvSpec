<h2>Single Molecule Spectroscopy</h2>
<p>Molecules can diffuse out of detection volume</p>
<p>HIgh fluorescence quantum yield, emits every photon it absorbs</p>
<p>Longwave length excitation minimizes influesnces from scattering</p>
<p>high photostability </p>
<p>Low intersystem crossing
    Non radiative process (often)
        Triplet state has long lifetime
        Molecule cant fluoresce 
        higher likelyhood of quenching
        higher likelyhood of photobleaching</p>
<p>The smaller the sample volume the less likely interference from impurities</p>
<p>Single molecule at room temperature
    molecule moves and changes its conformation
    phonon vibrations
    solvent molecules around it move</p>
<p>inhomogeneous broadening:
    electron phonon interactions
    matrix orientation
homogenous broadening
    dynamic processes</p>
<p>-&gt; then only limited by heisenberg</p>
<p>Cooling single molecules to cryogenic temperatures reduces electron phonon interactions 
(coupling between electronic state and vibrations of surrounding lattice)</p>
<h2>FLN</h2>
<p>since we only excite a single species we can resolve the phonon sidebands</p>
<p>phonon sidebands tell us about how the molecule is interacting with the lattice</p>
<p>Infer nature of bond by comparing sidebands from experiment with well known interactions</p>
<h2>Raman and IR</h2>
<p>complementary techniques</p>
<h3>IR</h3>
<p>Selection rule:
    Must cause change in electric dipole moment
    vibration cannot be symmetric like 0_2,...</p>
<h3>Raman</h3>
<p>Selection rule:
    must change polarizability
    vibration involving larger atoms
    conjugated dubble bonds
    many similar bonds (rings)</p>
<p>Raman signals are weak:
    inelastic scattering
    orders of magnitude less likely than rayleigh</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code>shorter exciation increases signal
4th power of scattered frequency
    -&gt; shorter frequecny is better but more fluorescecne interferene</code></pre>
<p>Major problem: fluorescence
- shifted excitation wavelength spectroscopy
- deep uv excitation
- time gated detection
    - detector needs to be rapidly gated (intensifier)
    - 10-100 fold suppression
    - system needs very careful calibration
    - shorter laser pulses mean broader bandwidth
    - intensifier can broaden spectrum slightly
    - can also be used to resolve depth
        - optical path length depends on refractive index and scattering probability</p>
<h2>Fluorescence</h2>
<p>reabsorbance</p>
<p>varying sensitivity of graitng/detector</p>
<p>interference from impurities</p>
<h2>Lasers</h2>
<p>Saturation:
- rate of excitation is the same or higher as rate of relaxation
    - depletion of ground state
- Unlikely with CW
- Often in single molecule exciation (pulsed laser)</p>
<p>Photodegradation</p>
<h3>Quenching</h3>
<p>Differentiate by measuring the fluorescence lifetime</p>
<h4>Static</h4>
<p>quencher binds directly to fluorophore</p>
<p>form stable non fluorescent complex</p>
<p>depends on binding constant of complex and quencher concentration</p>
<p>number of fluorescence molecules is reduced but lifetime of excited state is not reduced</p>
<h4>Dynamic</h4>
<p>Collision between excited state fluorophore and quencher on very fast timescale (ns)</p>
<p>efficiency depends on quencher concentration and collision rate also on fluorescence lifetime</p>
<h2>Separation methods</h2>
<p>Lack of broad tunability is liming factor</p>
<p>Real world samples have strong fluorescent background</p>
<h2>Phosphorescence</h2>
<p>Can be used in separation</p>
<p>Singlet to Triplet state</p>
<p>Lifetimes in microsecond range</p>
<p>time gated detection</p>
<p>more time for diffusion due to longer lifetime</p>
<p>quenching highly likely with oxygen</p>
<ul>
<li>quenched detection modes:<ul>
<li>use strong phosphorophore to generate constant signal</li>
<li>reagent quenches phosphorescence</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>sensitized phosphorescence:</p>
<ul>
<li>add strong phosphorophore</li>
<li>analyte transfers energy to the phosphorophore and enhances its emission</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>chiral separations</p>
<ul>
<li>quenching can be different for the two versions of the chiral phosphorophore</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>fluorescence probes</h2>
<ul>
<li>local polarity<ul>
<li>polarity of the solvent influences the emission wavelength of the fluorophore</li>
<li>A strong red shift is caused by a strong charge separation in the excited state (see [[notes NotebookLM audio 1 AdvSpec#Solvatochrmoism]])</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>pH</li>
<li>viscosity (how fast things can change)</li>
<li>Ion concentration</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fret</h2>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h2>Solvatochrmoism (Polarity Probe)</h2>
<p>Electron distribution becomes more polarized in excited state</p>
<ul>
<li>Solvent molecules reorientate to stabilize this new electron distribution</li>
<li>The more polar the solvent the more the excited state is stabilized</li>
<li>stabilization means the excited states energy is lowered
    -&gt; emission to ground state wavelength increases
    -&gt; ground state energy is also raised slightly (becuase the solvent molecules have reoriented, so that the excited state is more energetically favorable)</li>
<li>Depends on how quickly the solvent molecules can reorientate
    -&gt; For high Viscosity the excited state cannot be fully stabilized before the molecule emits
    -&gt; Shorter wavelength than for lower viscosity and same polarity of solvent</li>
<li>can be used to classify micro plastics<ul>
<li>Nile Red is used to as a fluorescent dye</li>
<li>NR adsorbs to the surface of polymers but not other stuff in the solution</li>
<li>surface polarity is different between differnt types of plastics, which results in a different emission wavelength of the fluorescence of NR</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>pH sensitivity</h3>
<ul>
<li>different properties for protonated (acidic) and deprotonated (basic) forms. Ratio depedns on local pH and probes pK<span class="arithmatex">\(_a\)</span>  (pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]))</li>
<li>Intensity based pH probes:<ul>
<li>acidic and basic forms of fluorophore have different quantum yields (<span class="arithmatex">\(\phi\)</span>)</li>
<li>if one form is highly fluorescent, the total emission will tell us about changes in pH</li>
<li>Disadvantages:<ul>
<li>Probe concentration must be well known</li>
<li>Inner filter effects</li>
<li>Photodegradation affects measurements</li>
<li>Instrument variations</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ratiometric pH probes<ul>
<li>acidic and basic forms have different emission wavelengths
-&gt; Measure fluorescence at two different wavelengths and look at ratio
-&gt; Eliminates concetration dependence</li>
<li>Example: Excited-State Intramolecular Proton Transfer (ESIPT)<ul>
<li>In the excited state the molecule transfers a proton from one site to another, changing its emission properties, this depends on ph and polarity</li>
<li>Back proton transfer (BPT) in ground state</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Viscosity Porbes 2</h3>
<p>Fluorescent molecules have a transition dipole moment, we get maximum absorption for light that is polarized parallel to the dipole moment.</p>
<p>Similar for emission</p>
<p>-&gt; If molecules dont move during excited state lifetime polarization is kept
-&gt; If molecules do move it is scrambled
-&gt; how much they move depends on solvent viscosity</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(P = (I_{‖} - I_{⊥}) / (I_{‖} + I_{⊥}) \leq 0.5\)</span> </p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(P=0\)</span> means completely free rotation</p>
<p>Applications:
- Folded Protein Immobilized vs Unfolded protein: probe is mobile
- Drug: bound -&gt; relatively fixed, free -&gt; can rotate freely</p>
