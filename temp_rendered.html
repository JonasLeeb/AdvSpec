<h1>Lecture 2 Adv Spectroscopy IR and Raman Spectroscopy</h1>
<h2>Molecular Vibrations</h2>
<h3>Fundamentals</h3>
<ul>
<li>Can be modeled as harmonic oscillators (spring-mass system)</li>
<li>Frequency depends on bond strength and atomic masses<ul>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(\nu = \frac{1}{2\pi}{\sqrt{ \frac{{k(m_{1}+m_{2})}}{m_{1}\cdot m_{2}} }}\)</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Two complementary techniques to probe this mode: IR absorption and Raman scattering</li>
</ul>
<h3>IR vs Raman Selection Rules</h3>
<ul>
<li>IR: Requires change in electric dipole moment during vibration <ul>
<li>light needs to couple to the vibration, this only works if there is a change in dipole moment</li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(C=C\)</span> stretch works since double (and triple) bonds are easily polarizable</li>
<li>symmetric molecules like <span class="arithmatex">\(CO_2\)</span> don't work</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Raman: Requires polarizability to change during the vibration<ul>
<li>Raman distorts the electronic cloud, if the cloud is easily distorted and this changes the polarizability (symmetric distortion often don't change polarizability) one gets a strong Raman signal </li>
<li>Polarizablility is affected by: size of atoms (larger is better), conjugated systems (Delocalized electrons is good), symmetric molecules (often highly polarizable), many identical bonds</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For more see [[Notes on selection rules for Raman and IR (AI)]]</li>
</ul>
<h2>Raman scattering mechanism</h2>
<ul>
<li>most scattering is elastic (<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">Rayleigh</span>), so no change in energy</li>
<li>much rarer: part of the photon energy is transferred into a vibrational mode of the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mole</span><span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 0)">cule</span></li>
<li>difference in energy corresponds to a vibrational quantum</li>
<li><em>Stokes:</em> electron is in the ground state before excitation</li>
<li><em>Anti-Stokes:</em> electron is in a vibrational state -&gt; Raman scattered photon can get higher energy than before scattering (much rarer, since dependent on vibrational level it is bolzmann distributed)<ul>
<li>Ratio of anti stokes vs stokes <span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{N_{1}}{N_{0}}=\exp\left( -\frac{\Delta E}{kT} \right)\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(kT \approx 200 cm^{-1}\)</span> at room T (or 210 cm<span class="arithmatex">\(^{-1}\)</span> at 300K)</li>
<li>If Temperature is not room temp use formula from [[Lecture 1 Adv Spectroscopy Fluorescence]], but watch out for the units (cm<span class="arithmatex">\(^{-1}\)</span>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Usually we measure the shift from the original energy of the photon (Raman shift), so that the original energy doesn't matter</li>
<li>Raman intensity: <span class="arithmatex">\(I_{R} = k \cdot l_{0} \cdot \alpha \cdot v_{4}\)</span><ul>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(I_{0}\)</span> is the laser power, which depends on the absorption and photodamage</li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(\alpha\)</span> is the polarizability (molecular property), which can be influenced in RRS</li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(k\)</span> is the instrument factor. This must be optimized</li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(v^4\)</span> is an effect that increases the Raman signal dramatically for shorter excitation wavelengths (longer wavelengths are more commonly used due to less fluorescence interference)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Applications of Raman Spectroscopy</h2>
<ul>
<li>Art authentication (Fast, simple, non invasive)</li>
<li>Identification of microplastics</li>
<li>Cancer diagnosis (small differences in lipid/protein ratios)</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h2>Practical Advantages and Limitations</h2>
<h3>Strengths</h3>
<ul>
<li>Boadly applicable</li>
<li>Possible to measure in-situ</li>
<li>Non-contact, non-destructive</li>
<li>Molecular identification (also gives information about the environment, crystal form, binding, etc)</li>
<li>Little or no sample prep required</li>
<li>Little interference from water</li>
<li>Submicrometer  spatial resolution</li>
</ul>
<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
<ul>
<li>Inherently weak signal</li>
<li>Spectral resolution (line width) limited by bandwidth of excitation source</li>
<li>Poor sensitivity under dilute conditions (Raman signal dominated by solvent/matrix)</li>
<li>For low energy excitation (NIR) the resulting Raman photons have very low energy and are hard to detect, especially for higher vibrational states

</ul>
<h2>Setups</h2>
<ul>
<li>Laser purity is essential, non pure laser will cause stray peaks</li>
<li>Often backscattering setup (90 degree or not) setup</li>
<li>Transmission setup for less signal from surface</li>
<li>Fiber optic setups also possible (6 fibers for collection around one fiber for excitation)<ul>
<li>Fiber optics have problem of also causing Raman signal:<ul>
<li>use Bandpass filter at the end of excitation fiber to filter out Raman from fiber</li>
<li>use long pass filter at entrance of collection fiber to filter our reflected laser light</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Special modes of Raman</h2>
<h3>Resonance Raman Spectroscopy (RRS)</h3>
<h4>Concept:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use excitation wavelength close to actual excited state (vibrational state of <span class="arithmatex">\(S_1\)</span>)
    --&gt; Raman signals are orders of magnitude stronger</li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(\alpha \approx \frac{1}{\omega_{Gl} - \omega_{L}- i T_{l}}\)</span></li>
<li>Denominator becomes very small near excited states</li>
<li>Only transitions that match the geometry change in the excited state get enhanced</li>
</ul>
<h4>Result:</h4>
<p>Signal is enhanced by several orders of magnitude, but only for the chromophore (the part of a molecule that absorbs vis/UV light)</p>
<h4>Problem:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Strong fluorescence interference often stronger than Raman signal</li>
<li>Loss of information, since only chromophore bands are enhanced</li>
</ul>
<h4>Options to reduce fluorescence</h4>
<ul>
<li>Shifted excitation wavelength</li>
<li>Adding quenchers (e.g. <span class="arithmatex">\(O_2\)</span>)</li>
<li>Deep-UV excitation &lt; 260 nm</li>
<li>Time-gated detection</li>
</ul>
<h3>Time-Resolved Raman</h3>
<h4>Fluorescence suppression</h4>
<ul>
<li>Excitation: ps pulsed laser</li>
<li>
<p>Raman process is instantaneous -&gt; faster than fluorescence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gated detector closes before most of the fluorescence signal arrives (closing achieved using an Intensifier than can be switched off (Multichannel plate))</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Achieves 10-100x fluorescence suppression</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Problem: For large samples not all the Raman signal arrives fast enough </p>
<p>![[Pasted image 20250611162117.png|500]]</p>
<h4>Subsurface Analysis (TRRS)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Raman photons from deeper layers arrive at the detector at a later time due to scattering</li>
<li>Different time windows select different depths</li>
<li>Effective photon speed 20x slower than in scattering media</li>
<li>Applications: explosives detection through containers, astrobiology (looking inside stones)</li>
</ul>
